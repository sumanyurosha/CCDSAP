CCDSAP Plan
I will track my daily progress in this .readme file.
14 April:
	Topics
		1.)Basic Dynamic Programming --> little bit know how, but need to practice a lot. [IMPORTANT topic]
		2.)Sorting --> a fair idea about them.
		3.)Binary Search --> a good idea about the implementation aspects, but need to practice a bit more to understand it in a better way. [IMPORTANT topic]
		4.)Heaps (priority queue) --> no idea, but once I understand, some practice questions will be good enough.
		5.)Disjoint Set Union --> no idea, but once I understand, some practice questions will be good enough.
		6.)Segment Trees --> know a little bit, need to practice a lot, since it is a very [IMPORTANT topic].
		7.)Binary Index Tree (Fenwick tree) --> no idea, but once I understand, some practice questions will be good enough.
		8.)Trees (traversals, tree dynamic programming) --> again, very [IMPORTANT topic], needs a good command over algos. and [Practice]
		9.)Finding Lowest Common Ancestors (O(log N) solution where N is number of nodes). --> no idea.
		10.)Graph Algorithms:
			1.)Finding connected components and transitive closures.
			2.)Shortest-path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
			3.)Minimum spanning tree (Prim and Kruskal algorithms)
			4.)Biconnectivity in undirected graphs (bridges, articulation points)
			5.)Strongly connected components in directed graphs
			6.)Topological Sorting
			7.)Euler path, tour/cycle.
		11.)Modular arithmetic including division, inverse --> [Concept game]
		12.)Amortized Analysis
		13.)Divide and Conquer --> a vast topic, [Practice] is very important.[IMPORTANT topic]
		14.)Advanced Dynamic Programming problems (excluding the dp optimizations which are added in expert level)
		15.)Sieve of Eratosthenes --> have a fair idea.
